## Vision Parse
I was looking for an open-source PDF to Markdown library and came across [vision-parse](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse) by [iamarunbrahma](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma). The library did such a good job converting tables and getting text into LLM-friendly .md format that I decided to give it a simple Streamlit UI. Keeping it open source so people can do what they like with it!

## What it does

- Supports multiple AI vision models:
 - OpenAI (GPT-4o)
 - Google Gemini
 - Meta's Llama & LLaVA
- Shows real-time conversion progress
- Displays markdown output page by page
