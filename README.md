## The Story
I was looking for an open-source PDF to Markdown library and came across [vision-parse](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse) by [iamarunbrahma](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma). The library did such a good job converting tables and getting text into LLM-friendly .md format that I decided to give it a simple Streamlit UI. Keeping it open source so people can do what they like with it!

## What it does
- Provides a simple web interface to convert PDFs to Markdown
- Supports multiple AI vision models:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4V)
  - Google Gemini
  - Meta's Llama & LLaVA
- Shows real-time conversion progress
- Displays markdown output page by page

## Getting Started

## Credits
This project wouldn't exist without [vision-parse](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma/vision-parse) by [iamarunbrahma](https://github.com/iamarunbrahma). All the heavy lifting of PDF processing and AI model integration is handled by their excellent library.
